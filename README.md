## XDHealthCheck / CTXHealthCheck

Functions to connect to a Citrix Farm and extract details for a HTML Health check Dashboard

**To get started run the following:**

- ```Install-Module -Name CTXHealthCheck```
- ```Import-Module CTXHealthCheck```
- ```Install-CTXHealthCheckParameters```


And answer the setup questions.

Once everything is setup you can run  ```Initialize-CitrixHealthCheck -XMLParameterFilePath <ParametersFile>``` for the main health check report.
  
Iâ€™ve also created a couple of smaller reports for you to explorer.
